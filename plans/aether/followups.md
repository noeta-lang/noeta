# noeta-aether — deferred follow-ups (address before the arc closes)

Tracked language/runtime gaps surfaced while building the framework. Revisit each when the
noeta-aether arc completes (before merge).

## F1 — Match arms are expression-only
A `match` arm body with statements/reassignment does NOT parse:
```noe
match r {
    Ok(v) => { x = v }        // E0003 — `{ x = v }` block-with-reassignment is not an expression arm
    Err(e) => { return "..." }
}
```
Arms must be expressions today; framework code works around it with `.map`, expression arms, and
early-return helpers (`arg_for` in the DI router). This is an ergonomic wall a real framework hits
constantly. **Follow-up:** support block/statement bodies in match arms (a general language slice —
lower a block arm to a scoped statement sequence with a tail value). Surfaced during L2.4 DI router.

## F2 — Deserialize recipes don't register in the checkerless REPL `extend` path
`@derive(Deserialize<Json>)` records its `TypeRecipe` via the checker's `type_to_recipe`. The REPL
session's `extend` path (`noeta-compiler` `extend_impl`) lowers checkerless, so a deserializable type
DECLARED IN A REPL ENTRY won't register for `json.decode_typed` (same limitation class as
`tojson_derives` / `comparable_derives`). The checked whole-program path (CLI `run`/`build`, tests,
serve) is fully covered — only interactive REPL redefinition is affected. **Follow-up:** thread a
recipe recompute into the session path (or run a lightweight `type_to_recipe` pass in `extend`) so
REPL-declared deserializable types work. Surfaced during L2.2.
