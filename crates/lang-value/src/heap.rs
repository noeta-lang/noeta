//! The heap: manually-allocated, manually-refcounted objects behind a NaN-boxed pointer.
//!
//! This is the **only** module in the workspace that uses `unsafe`. It is kept small and
//! pure on purpose so `miri` can cover it: every `unsafe` here is either the int↔pointer
//! round-trip (via the exposed-provenance API, which is the `miri`-sound way to stash a
//! pointer in an integer) or a deref of an object this module itself allocated.
//!
//! An [`Obj`] is `Box`-allocated, its raw address stashed in a [`Value`] by the codec in
//! `lib.rs`, and freed by reconstructing the `Box`. Refcounts are non-atomic — the runtime
//! is shared-nothing per isolate, so no value crosses a thread boundary.
